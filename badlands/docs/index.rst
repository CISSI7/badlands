Getting started with badlands
====================================

`Basin and Landscape Dynamics` (Badlands) is a long-term surface evolution model
built to simulate landscape development, sediment transport and sedimentary basins formation
from upstream regions down to marine environments.

----------

What's in the box?
------------------

Badlands is an open-source Python-based code and can be used to simulate:

* hillslope processes (*linear* & *non-linear* diffusion),
* fluvial incision (*Stream Power Law*, *Transport Capacity Law*)
* sediment transport and deposition,
* wave-induced longshore drift transport,
* reef growth and carbonate platform formation,
* submarine gravity currents (turbidity currents),
* spatially and temporally varying tectonic (horizontal + vertical displacements) and
* effects of climate changes (rainfall) and/or sea-level fluctuations.
