         It is possible to modify the erodibility coefficient to explicitly incorporate:
          + the effect of local mean annual precipitation rate, and
          + the effect of bedload sediment vs water discharge,
          + where the dependency of bedload transport is related to the upstream slope.
         An example of how to define these functions is provided in the erodibilityFct notebook
         in pyBadlands Companion. -->

        <!-- Erodibility dependence to the precipitation is defined with an exponent.

        <!-- Erodibility dependence to the bedload sediment supply is defined in a file.
           The file can be created with the erodibilityFct notebook in pyBadlands Companion,
           it consists of 2 columns: first column is the ratio of bedload versus water fluxes and
           the second is the erodibility factor (all values are between [0,1])

           a file that can be created with the erodibilityFct notebook in pyBadlands Companion.
           it consists of 2 columns: first column is the upstream slope [m/m] and the second
